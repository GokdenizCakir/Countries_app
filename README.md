# Countries_app
Implemented the feature to query the public Countries GraphQL API, displaying results in a list. Added a text filter for searching and grouping, such as "search:tt group:size." Enabled selection and de-selection of list items, allowing only one item to be selected at a time. Applied a distinct background color for selected items from a predefined set, ensuring it differs from the previously selected item. Considering potential long lists.
